# MPESA Transaction Analyzer SaaS Development Plan

## Objective
Develop a SaaS product for credit providers in unbanked communities and individuals, leveraging MPESA transaction data for insights and analysis.

## Technologies
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js (via Next.js)
- **Database & Authentication**: Supabase
- **AI Insights**: Google API (gemini-2.0-flash) for development, OpenAI for production

## Phases

### Phase 1: Setup and Infrastructure
1. **Initialize Next.js Project**
   - Set up a new Next.js project with React and Tailwind CSS.
   - Configure Tailwind CSS for styling.

2. **Integrate Supabase**

   - Define database schema for storing transaction data and user information.

3. **Develop Landing Page**
   - Integrate existing landing page into the Next.js project.
   - Ensure responsiveness and optimize for SEO.

### Phase 2: Backend Development
1. **API Development**
   - Create RESTful APIs using Next.js for transaction data handling.
   - Implement authentication and authorization using Supabase.

2. **API Offering**
   - Develop a public API for businesses to integrate transaction analysis services.
   - Ensure secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - Provide detailed API documentation and support for integration.

3. **Spending Habit Analysis**
   - Develop features to analyze individual spending patterns.
   - Create visualizations to show spending categories and trends over time.
   - Implement user-specific dashboards for personalized insights.

4. **PDF Report Generation**
